\chapter{Image Acquisition and calibration}

As mentioned in the system architecture, images need to be taken simultaneously. There also needs to be two cameras due to the way the cameras are constructed, with a Bayer matrix for each pixel. At the time of inception, one could either isolate an infrared channel, or view fully RGB with separate cameras. Attempts to have both on a single camera were ineffective[].\\
