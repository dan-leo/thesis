\chapter{Image Processing and NDVI}
SIFT, mapping, geotagging, alignment,

Finally, a scale-invariant-feature-transform is applied to the images to align them using an affine transform. An NDVI calculation is applied to the matched images, with a floating point output image. A LUT colourmap is applied to visibly distinguish different areas and their meanings in the final image.

\section{Stitching and mapping}

A few images are stitched together to show proof-of-concept.
